![demo](assets/demo.mp4)

Save a batch of sequentially numbered image URLs. (You can also create a PDF file.)

Image URLs are often stored with sequential numbers. For example,

- Gallery of product images
- Books (PDF) stored as images

Serial is an application that allows you to save these images in a batch on your smartphone and create PDF files.

## How to use

1. Copy one of the URLs stored in a sequential number.
2. Enter a title (optional)
3. Start downloading by clicking the button in the lower right corner.

If PDF is ON, the PDF is displayed, if OFF, the image is saved in the application folder.

**URL format example: https://~n.jpg**

`n` is an integer
There is no restriction on the extension, but everything is saved as jpg.

**Warinig:** iOS is stable, but Android is still adjusting.
